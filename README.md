# Internet-and-Networking
Introduction to networking book excert

The US initiated research activity Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) developed as a system for global data communication service known as the Internet. 


Today, internet is operated as a joint effort by many organizations.In this page we will learn basic concepts of internet, also mechanisms and technologies that evovled in the  deployment of it. 


**Evolution of Internet**

In 1969 the US defence departpart developed a robust network as a project named as the ARPANET which should be resilient to even bombing. The initial objective to develop internet network is to secure and robust enough to withstand even a nuclear attack. They distributed network in order to avoid attacks on the central authority.This led to the development of Local Area Network and workstations equipped with the ability to connect. Then the ARPANET project get catalysed the rapid evolution over decades. Initialy ARPANET used as National Control Protocol (NCP) with some standard set of rules for communication between the computers connected to ARPANET. However due to its rapid development of the information
technology, NCP was replaced by the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). 


**TCP - transmission control protocol**

its a protocol which fragments the information or messages into packets at the source and reassembly of these packets at the destination. The transmission of these packets from source to
destination is handled by the IP (Internet protocol). 


**IP - Internet protocol**

IP protocol is responsible to takes care the addressing conventions and ensuring the delivery of the packet at the correct destination across multiple nodes or even across multiple networks.  

**Internet**

The Internet is “the global system of interconnected computer networks that are linked together by devices called routers and use a common set of protocols for data transmission known as TCP/IP
(transmission control protocol / Internet protocol)to link devices worldwide.” The internet's primary purpose is to share the information using different tools some of them are  email, list servers, newsgroups, telnet, gopher, FTP, and the World Wide Web. The most popular tool is World Wide Web. 

It has changed our usual chores that we perform in our daily life. the basic tasks we perform kile sending email, chcking our train schedule, paying bills, social networking everything is due to internet. 

Internet includes various networks together that include public, private, government, business, and academic sectors, using different electronic technologies. It interconnects global networks with local networks and vise-versa.


**What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?**

We all heard a term called World Wide Web, so What does it mean?
The WWW is a tool to used exchange the information between a internet and computer and by tyinng them together to vasst connection. Web and internet are not the same web uses internet to pass the data. The Web is a collection of interconnected documents which are web pages and also other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs.


**HTTP**

hypertext transfer protocol, this is a protocol being used for
communication. For example the standard URL is http://www.google.com, the http protocol will be the prefix of standard URL. the http protocol is used to access hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. 

URLs are the uniform resource locator, it is a unique identifier that is contained all the resources available on the internet. due to its uniqueness it will help to locate a particular resource.
